# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.2

### Changes
* If a button is inactive (as in it has no functionality yet), but has no LED to allow visual feedback, it will now show on the screen as "Button currently inactive" when clicked.

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue with the mixer volume & pan tracking (which was delayed and inaccurate)
* Not really a bugfix, but I added a crash handler which can help showing when the program crashes

## v0.0.1 - Initial Release
First release!

### Features
* 'Undo', 'Play', 'Stop', 'Record', 'Pattern/Song Toggle' buttons now functional
* Selected mixer track info & volume/pan settings showing in the 16x2 characters screen

Any kind of functionality for the pads, faders and knobs is currently inexistant, but that'll come soon hopefully.
