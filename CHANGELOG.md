# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.2

## Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue with the mixer volume & pan tracking (which was delayed)
* Not really a bugfix, but I added a crash handler which can help showing when the program crashes


## v0.0.1 - Initial Release
First release!

## Features

* 'Undo', 'Play', 'Stop', 'Record', 'Pattern/Song Toggle' buttons now functional
* Selected mixer track info & volume/pan settings showing in the 16x2 characters screen

Any kind of functionality for the pads, faders and knobs is currently inexistant, but that'll come soon hopefully.
